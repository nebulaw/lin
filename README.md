# Lin - Fast, Reliable Project Overview System

Lin is a versatile acronym that can represent anything you wish. it's important
to remember that Lin is simply a tool designed to help you oversee your project
and monitor its progress.

## Idea
Lin works from from the shadows. It helps you to track your progress
while developing your projects. It is not a tool like git or mercurial is,
it is not far from them but with less and some specific features. It manages
todo-comments and total lines of grouped files by checkpointing group's state.
I really have no idea why one might use this but here it is.

## Build

You can build the project by running the following commands:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

## Development
The project is in a development process, so you might expect bugs or unexpected
behaviours. Reporting any issues or new ideas will be a really good contribution
for better experience.
